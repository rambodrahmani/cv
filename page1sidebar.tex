As the manager of the driverless division, I directed the comprehensive transformation of our combustion vehicle into an autonomous racing platform, culminating in victory at the Formula SAE Italy 2021 Engineering Design Event. I oversaw the intricate integration of hardware components, such as NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, Hesai Pandar 40P Lidar and Stereolabs ZED 2 Stereo camera. I Spearheaded the development of a robust software stack grounded in ROS, C++, Python, PyTorch, NVIDIA TensorRT, NVIDIA CUDA, PointCloud Library, OpenCV and CasADi, incorporating deep learning-driven perception, Model Predictive Control for trajectory planning, and precision low-level control based on FAULHABER drive systems. The project also involved the development and utilization of a simulator based on Unreal Engine with the AirSim plugin which served as a pivotal tool for validating the autonomous vehicle's software and control systems in a photorealistic 3D environment.
