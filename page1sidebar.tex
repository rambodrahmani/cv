As the driverless division manager, I led the transformation of our vehicle into an autonomous racer, winning Formula SAE Italy 2021's Engineering Design Event. I managed complex hardware integration, including NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, Hesai Pandar 40P Lidar, and Stereolabs ZED 2 Stereo Camera. Our software stack, grounded in ROS, C++, Python, PyTorch, NVIDIA TensorRT, CUDA, PointCloud Library, OpenCV, and CasADi, featured deep learning perception and Model Predictive Control. We also leveraged a simulator, using Unreal Engine with AirSim, for rigorous testing in a lifelike 3D environment. This comprehensive effort showcased our prowess in autonomous racing technology.
